# Avent of Code 2023 - language zoo 🦒🦏🦓

# Rules

- Complete part 1 of each day in a different language.
  - _What counts as a new language?_
    - Using a 'superset language' (C++) but not using its new features doesn't count.
    - Languages that _can_ be compiled to another language (e.g. typescript to javascript), do count (mainly cause I want to try typescript)
    - Not allowed to write code in one language and transpile it to another.
- Other languages can be used to transform the program input, if necessary.

- Part 2 can be completed in any language, or just skipped (I would like to have some free time this month)

_Day 10 (Processing) - the newly-discovered pipes are drawn on each 'frame' - could be sped up much more by doing more iterations per frame, etc._
