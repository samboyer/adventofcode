# Avent of Code 2024: Pythonji 🎄🔥🧾🚣‍♂️🎉🎅🎄

Coding with emojis. Wish me luck.
Currently using `https://github.com/gahjelle/pythonji` for execution. I may have to fork it soon to add some other features (module imports mainly).

## Rules
- Emojis only for variable & function names, and comments
- Python keywords (`for`, `in`, `return` etc) are allowed
- Method functions of builtin/3rd-party types (e.g. `str.split`) may use their original spelling (I can't be bothered to inject my own methods)
